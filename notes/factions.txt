Dawes Mining Company: 
Harvests and exports natural resources from the valley, currently holds a monopoly on said mining. 
Wants to lift the curse so they have better access to water, but knows that the Gramont family will also make a play for mining should the curse be lifted.

Gramont Family: 
Owns most of the civilian infrastructure in the valley as well as controls the key water reservoires (and therefore agriculture), 
selling water at high prices to the civilian population and the DMC. Wants to lift the curse so they can move out into more mining, 
but knows that the DMC will make a play for that mining as well as have better access to water.

Workers / Liberation front: 
People lured to the Valley by the DMC in a gold rush only to be trapped there by high costs of living by the Gramont family 
as well as ludicrous working conditions and cost of a ticket out of the valley. Wants to take control of the city of Oasis 
(owned by the Gramont family) as well as the water supplies so they can sustain themselves primarily - wants to lift the curse so 
that they wont run out of resources in the valley (as the water reservoire is thinning), but knows that if the Gramont and Dawes groups will 
render them obsolete and waylaid if the curse is lifted

Valley People / Sand Elves: 
Displaced peoples who are native to the valley when the first settlers arrived. Wants to reclaim their territory from the 
Gramont and Dawes groups, holds grudges against the workers for being complicit. Lifting the curse allows them to migrate across territory 
originally theirs, but they know that Gramont & Dawes will just bring more industry if given the chance.
